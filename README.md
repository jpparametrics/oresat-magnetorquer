# PSAS-Magnetorquer
Magnetorquer design for Oregon's First Satellite

At the moment, there is just some information for clean-sheet conceptual design of a magnetorquer. More to come, pending math.

This repo contains an archive with STL and solidworks files for an early design of the magnetorquers, as well as copies of equations used, simulations and dimensioning.
